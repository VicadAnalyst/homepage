Here you can find my handbooks that I created for myself while studying classic ML algorithms to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts behind these algorithms.

Keep in mind that the handbooks were created for educational purposes, and they don't show how to apply the algorithms in the most efficient way, but rather explain how the algorithms work.
