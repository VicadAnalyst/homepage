Welcome to Vicad Analyst!

I'm a data enthusiast and a curious learner, currently working in the DA field. <br>
You can expect to see here my pet projects, experiments, analysis of take-home assignments and my personal notes that I take while learning new things. <br>
I really like the idea of learning in public, which you can read more about [here](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), so if you have any ideas or want to cooperate, feel free to DM me in Telegram.
