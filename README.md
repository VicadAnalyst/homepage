Welcome!

Here I'm going to publish my pet projects and other materials. I work in the data field, so most things will be related to **DA,  DS and ML**. <br>
I really like the idea of learning in public, which you can read more about [here]!(https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), so I'll also publish what I've learned along my journey. <p>
